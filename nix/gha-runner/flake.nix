  # FlexNetOS self-hosted GitHub runner — composed design, pure Nix flake.
  #
  # TWO LAYERS, ONE CLOSURE (zero OS system dependencies — no systemd, no host
  # services, no apt/host packages):
  #
  #   1. SUBSTRATE — nixpkgs `github-runner` (the real actions/runner). Registered
  #      to the FlexNetOS org with labels [self-hosted, flexnetos, nix]; executes
  #      ALL GitHub workflows/actions, including the archbp-* environment tests.
  #      nixpkgs patches it to resolve mutable state from env vars, so it runs
  #      from the immutable store with state under the profile-runtime link.
  #
  #   2. rUv AGENT LAYER — a metaharness harness (@metaharness/kernel +
  #      @metaharness/host-github-actions + agentic-flow) that workflows invoke
  #      AS A STEP on the substrate (ADR-033; cf. worldgraph.yml with
  #      runs-on swapped to the self-hosted labels). Plain ESM bin/cli.js, no
  #      build step, executed via bun.
  #
  # Grounded in rUv source:
  #   metaharness/docs/adrs/ADR-033-host-github-actions.md   (GHA host adapter, --gha-mode)
  #   metaharness/packages/host-github-actions/package.json  (v0.1.2)
  #   worldgraph/.github/workflows/worldgraph.yml            (harness runs ON a runner)
